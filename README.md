Work done for the C++ Introductory UCPH course Applied Programming: https://kurser.ku.dk/course/ndak14007u/2022-2023.
Work includes four handins obligatory for the course.

Note that the code had to be passed by a rather stingy codechecker, necessitating cutting some of the functionality implemented in, for example handin3, to appease the checker.
Extended functionality for handin3 can be found in the appropriate folder therewithin.
